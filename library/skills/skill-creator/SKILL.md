description: Create new skills, modify and improve existing skills, and measure skill performance. Use when users want to create a skill from scratch, edit, or optimize an existing skill, run evals to test a skill, benchmark skill performance with variance analysis, or optimize a skill's description for better triggering accuracy.

# Skill Creator

A skill for creating new skills and iteratively improving them.

At a high level, the process of creating a skill goes like this:

- Decide what you want the skill to do and roughly how it should do it
- Write a draft of the skill
- Create a few test prompts and run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on them
- Help the user evaluate the results both qualitatively and quantitatively
- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results
- Repeat until you're satisfied

Your job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works?

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.

### Write the SKILL.md

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier (kebab-case, max 64 chars)
- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. Make descriptions slightly "pushy" to combat undertriggering.
- **the rest of the skill**

### Skill Writing Guide

#### Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
```

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

**Key patterns:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if approaching this limit, add hierarchy with clear pointers
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats:**
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern:**
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples.

### Test Cases

After writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts. Share them with the user for review. Save test cases to `evals/evals.json`:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "example-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "User's task prompt",
      "expected_output": "Description of expected result",
      "files": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Running and Evaluating Test Cases

For each test case, spawn two subagents — one with the skill, one without. Launch everything at once.

**With-skill run:**
```
Execute this task:
- Skill path: <path-to-skill>
- Task: <eval prompt>
- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/
```

**Baseline run** (same prompt, no skill, save to `without_skill/outputs/`).

While runs are in progress, draft quantitative assertions for each test case. Good assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names.

## Improving the Skill

1. **Generalize from the feedback.** Don't overfit to specific examples.
2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight.
3. **Explain the why.** Explain the reasoning behind instructions so the model understands importance.
4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** If all test cases independently wrote similar scripts, bundle that script in `scripts/`.

### The Iteration Loop

1. Apply improvements to the skill
2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory
3. Wait for the user to review
4. Read feedback, improve again, repeat

Keep going until the user is satisfied or feedback is all empty.

## Skill Location

New skills should be created at: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

This project uses forge for orchestration. When creating skills for this project, place them in the standard Claude Code skills directory so they're automatically available via `/skill-name`.
