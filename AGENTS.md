# Agent Instructions

forge-cli — a Go monolith CLI tool; the pure engine behind the forge toolkit.
This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Project

- **Name**: forge-cli
- **Language**: Go
- **Architecture**: monolith CLI tool

## Build & Test

- **Build**: `go build ./...`
- **Typecheck**: `go vet ./...`
- **Lint**: `golangci-lint run`
- **Test**: `go test ./...`

## Anti-Patterns (Blockers)

Do NOT introduce these:
- `TODO` / `FIXME` comments
- Hardcoded secrets or API keys

## Task Tracking (bd)

- Work is tracked via `bd` (steveyegge/beads) — a Dolt-backed issue tracker
- `bd ready` — see tasks with no open blockers
- `bd show <id>` — view issue details
- `bd update <id> --claim` — atomically claim a task
- `bd close <id> --reason "..."` — mark work complete
- `bd update <id> --add-label "key:value"` — add labels (NO `-l` shorthand for update)
- `bd ready -l "key:value"` — filter by labels (query commands DO support `-l`)
- `bd dolt push` — push beads data to the remote

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Releasing

After committing, use `make ship` to push, release, and update the local binary:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"   # post-commit hook auto-tags vX.Y.Z
make ship                 # push → GitHub Action → goreleaser → brew upgrade
```

- Tags are created automatically by `.githooks/post-commit` (patch+1, rolls over at 99)
- `make ship` pushes the commit + tag, waits for the GitHub Action to finish, then runs `brew upgrade`
- New clones need `make setup` to enable the git hooks

## Forge Toolkit

forge-cli is the **pure engine** — it bundles no skills of its own. Skills and hooks live in the
**forge-toolkit** (`~/.forge/`), installed into a repo by `forge init` / `forge sync`. Run
`forge list` to see what your toolkit currently provides.

**Routing rule:** any new skill or hook is added to the forge-toolkit first; only scope it to a
specific repo when explicitly stated otherwise.

### CLI Commands

```bash
forge list              # See all skills and agents
forge skill add <name>  # Create a new skill
forge skill remove <name> # Remove a skill
forge agent add <name>  # Create a new agent
forge agent remove <name> # Remove an agent
forge sync              # Pull/push toolkit changes
forge get <repo> <name> # Pull a skill from any repo
```

### Hooks

`forge init` (and `forge sync`) also install **hooks** from `~/.forge/hooks/manifest.json`,
so the workflow's guardrails travel with the toolkit — not just skills. The installer
walks the manifest generically (it switches on `kind`, never a hook's name); add a hook
by editing the manifest, not Go code. Each manifest entry sets `default` (auto-install)
and `scope` (`repo`); install an opt-in hook with `forge init --enable-hook <name>`.

- **Primary — git `pre-push` gate (`pre-push-validate.sh`, default).** Blocks
  `git push` of a branch whose receipt is missing/mismatched. `forge init` writes a
  committed `.githooks/pre-push` wrapper and sets `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`
  (relative → resolves per worktree, travels with the code); the wrapper resolves the
  personal gate at runtime (`$FORGE_HOME`/`$HOME/.forge`), so **no hardcoded paths**.
  It inspects the actual push refs on stdin, so it never false-blocks a message or
  script that merely contains "git push". A pre-existing hook is preserved as
  `pre-push.local` and chained; an already-set `core.hooksPath` is respected;
  re-runs are idempotent (`# forge-managed:` sentinel).
- **Receipt handshake.** `/validate` writes `<repo>/.claude/.validate-receipt` at its
  Definition of Done; line 1 is pipe-delimited and field 1 is the branch. Both gates
  read it — the push is allowed only when the receipt names the branch being pushed.
- **Opt-in — `PreToolUse(Bash)` validate-gate (`validate-gate.sh`, default:false).**
  Hard-blocks `gh pr create` until the receipt exists. Its command string-match is
  leaky (can false-block any Bash containing `gh pr create`), so it is **never**
  installed globally or into a commander session — only into a per-repo committed
  `.claude/settings.json` when explicitly opted in.
- **settings.json deep-merge guarantees.** Claude-settings hooks are deep-merged into
  the committed `.claude/settings.json` (not `settings.local.json`): every other key
  is preserved (`permissions`, unrelated matchers), the command is appended only if
  absent (idempotent), and the file is pretty-printed back. The forge binary does the
  write, bypassing Claude's auto-mode classifier that blocks agent edits to settings.
